# mlc-flask-shell

A simple shell for your interview. 

## Before the interview
1. From GitHub, use this repo 
[as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
to create your own copy
2. Set up a virtual environment. This is set up for poetry, so you could do `poetry install` and then `poetry shell`.
Or you could create it with your favorite tooling and install the packages in `requirements.txt`.
3. Make sure everything works by doing `flask --app webapp.main run` and going in a browser to the given URL.
You should see a very boring home page. If you click on "researcher app", you should find a basic working
Hello World app.

For the interview, please use your favorite development tools. If they allow for virtual pairing, please
set that up, as we can jump in and help. But if not, don't sweat it; you can just share your screen.
